    "# **Math - Linear Algebra**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Linear Algebra is the branch of mathematics that studies [vector spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space) and linear transformations between vector spaces, such as rotating a shape, scaling it up or down, translating it (ie. moving it), etc.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Machine Learning relies heavily on Linear Algebra, so it is essential to understand what vectors and matrices are, what operations you can perform with them, and how they can be useful.*"

    "# Vectors\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "A vector is a quantity defined by a magnitude and a direction. For example, a rocket's velocity is a 3-dimensional vector: its magnitude is the speed of the rocket, and its direction is (hopefully) up. A vector can be represented by an array of numbers called *scalars*. Each scalar corresponds to the magnitude of the vector with regards to each dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say the rocket is going up at a slight angle: it has a vertical speed of 5,000 m/s, and also a slight speed towards the East at 10 m/s, and a slight speed towards the North at 50 m/s. The rocket's velocity may be represented by the following vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "**velocity** $= \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "10 \\\\\n",
    "50 \\\\\n",
    "5000 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{pmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: by convention vectors are generally presented in the form of columns. Also, vector names are generally lowercase to distinguish them from matrices (which we will discuss below) and in bold (when possible) to distinguish them from simple scalar values such as ${meters\\_per\\_second} = 5026$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A list of N numbers may also represent the coordinates of a point in an N-dimensional space, so it is quite frequent to represent vectors as simple points instead of arrows. A vector with 1 element may be represented as an arrow or a point on an axis, a vector with 2 elements is an arrow or a point on a plane, a vector with 3 elements is an arrow or point in space, and a vector with N elements is an arrow or a point in an N-dimensional space… which most people find hard to imagine.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Purpose\n",
    "Vectors have many purposes in Machine Learning, most notably to represent observations and predictions. For example, say we built a Machine Learning system to classify videos into 3 categories (good, spam, clickbait) based on what we know about them. For each video, we would have a vector representing what we know about it, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "**video** $= \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "10.5 \\\\\n",
    "5.2 \\\\\n",
    "3.25 \\\\\n",
    "7.0\n",
    "\\end{pmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This vector could represent a video that lasts 10.5 minutes, but only 5.2% viewers watch for more than a minute, it gets 3.25 views per day on average, and it was flagged 7 times as spam. As you can see, each axis may have a different meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this vector our Machine Learning system may predict that there is an 80% probability that it is a spam video, 18% that it is clickbait, and 2% that it is a good video. This could be represented as the following vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "**class_probabilities** $= \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "0.80 \\\\\n",
    "0.18 \\\\\n",
    "0.02\n",
    "\\end{pmatrix}$"
