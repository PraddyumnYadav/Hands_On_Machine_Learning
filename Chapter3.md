# Classification on MNIST Dataset
- This Repository Contains a Machine Learning Model with sklearn Which is driven from "Hands on Machine Learning"
- In This Repository We Use Scikit-Learn, Jupyter Notebook, Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib.
- I Have Also Solved Exercise4 of HandsOnMachineLearning Book Chapter 3 Which You Can Get With Name [Spam_Classifier](https://github.com/PraddyumnYadav/Spam_Classifier) on my Github Account.
- Most Probaby i Will Work on GUI and Website of This Project Which Will not be Hosted.
