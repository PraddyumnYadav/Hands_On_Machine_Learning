But in This Chapter Finally We are Going to Look at **How Things Work Under the Hood**."

    "Let's say we have a dataset of housing prices in a certain area, and we want to predict the price of a house based on its size (in square feet) and the number of bedrooms. We can model this problem using linear regression, with the price of the house being the target variable and the size and number of bedrooms being the input features. \n",

    "\n",

    "For example, let's say we want to predict the price of a house that is 1700 square feet and has 3 bedrooms. We can plug these values into Equation 4-1 and use the learned values of $\\theta_0$, $\\theta_1$, and $\\theta_2$ to compute the predicted price as follows:\n",

Of course, the actual price may differ from the predicted price due to factors not captured by the input features, but the linear regression model provides a useful estimate based on the available information."
