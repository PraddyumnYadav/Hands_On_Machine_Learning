    "# Tools - Pandas\n",
    "*The `pandas` library provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools. The main data structure is the `DataFrame`, which you can think of as an in-memory 2D table (like a spreadsheet, with column names and row labels). Many features available in Excel are available programmatically, such as creating pivot tables, computing columns based on other columns, plotting graphs, etc. You can also group rows by column value, or join tables much like in SQL. Pandas is also great at handling time series.*\n",
