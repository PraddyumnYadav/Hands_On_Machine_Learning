    "Many Machine Learning Problems Involve thousands or even hundreds of features to Train the Models which In turn gives birth to **the curse of dimensionality**(Explained Later in the Chapter) and as a solution to this Problem comes Dimensionality Reduction here are two of the advantages of using Dimensionality Reduction :-\n",
