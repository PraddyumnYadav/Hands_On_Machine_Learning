    "# **Chapter 8 - Dimensionality Reduction**\n",
    "Many Machine Learning Problems Involve thousands or even hundreds of features to Train the Models which In turn gives birth to **the curse of dimensionality**(Explained Later in the Chapter) and as a solution to this Problem comes Dimensionality Reduction here are two of the advantages of using Dimensionality Reduction :-\n",

    "In Most Real World Problems the the Dataset is not Uniformly Distrubuted Throughout all Dimensions. Many Features are almost Constant.\n",
    "So in the Projection We Find out the Plane in which most of the data points lie and then Project the Whole Dataset on that specific Plane.\n",
    "However somtimes we cannot find a plane on the Dataset Like in the famous Swiss Roll Dataset in Which You have to unroll the dataset to get accurate representation.\n",
